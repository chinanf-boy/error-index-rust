## E0499

A variable was borrowed as mutable more than once. Erroneous code example:

```rust
let mut i = 0;
let mut x = &mut i;
let mut a = &mut i;
// error: cannot borrow `i` as mutable more than once at a time
```

Please note that in rust, you can either have many immutable references, or one mutable reference. Take a look at https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/references-and-borrowing.html for more information. Example:

```rust
let mut i = 0;
let mut x = &mut i; // ok!

// or:
let mut i = 0;
let a = &i; // ok!
let b = &i; // still ok!
let c = &i; // still ok!
```
