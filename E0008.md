## E0008

Names bound in match arms retain their type in pattern guards. As such, if a name is bound by move in a pattern, it should also be moved to wherever it is referenced in the pattern guard code. Doing so however would prevent the name from being available in the body of the match arm. Consider the following:

```rust
match Some("hi".to_string()) {
    Some(s) if s.len() == 0 => {}, // use s.
    _ => {},
}
```

The variable s has type String, and its use in the guard is as a variable of type String. The guard code effectively executes in a separate scope to the body of the arm, so the value would be moved into this anonymous scope and therefore becomes unavailable in the body of the arm.

The problem above can be solved by using the ref keyword.

```rust

match Some("hi".to_string()) {
    Some(ref s) if s.len() == 0 => {},
    _ => {},
}
```

Though this example seems innocuous and easy to solve, the problem becomes clear when it encounters functions which consume the value:

```rust
struct A{}

impl A {
    fn consume(self) -> usize {
        0
    }
}

fn main() {
    let a = Some(A{});
    match a {
        Some(y) if y.consume() > 0 => {}
        _ => {}
    }
}
```

In this situation, even the ref keyword cannot solve it, since borrowed content cannot be moved. This problem cannot be solved generally. If the value can be cloned, here is a not-so-specific solution:

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
struct A{}

impl A {
    fn consume(self) -> usize {
        0
    }
}

fn main() {
    let a = Some(A{});
    match a{
        Some(ref y) if y.clone().consume() > 0 => {}
        _ => {}
    }
}
```

If the value will be consumed in the pattern guard, using its clone will not move its ownership, so the code works.
